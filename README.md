# Arms Race Model — MATH 3MB3 Final Project

This project explores a mathematical model of an arms race between two competing nations. It examines how military spending evolves over time when each country responds to perceived threats, economic pressures, and underlying political attitudes such as goodwill or grievance.

The work was completed as the final project for MATH 3MB3 - Introduction to Modelling, at McMaster University.

## Project Overview

The model considers two economically competing countries, referred to as Purple and Green. Although both nations prefer peace and do not seek conflict, neither is willing to remain vulnerable. As a result, each country increases its military spending when it perceives the other as a threat.

At the same time, military expansion comes at an economic cost. Excessive spending places strain on each country’s economy, naturally limiting unchecked growth.

The objective of the project was to construct and analyze a continuous-time dynamical system that captures:

* Mutual fear, where one nation’s armament influences the other’s response
* Economic self-limitation due to internal costs
* The impact of underlying goodwill or persistent grievances
* Long-term equilibrium behavior
* Stability of military spending levels
* Extensions incorporating capacity limits through logistic terms

Through analytical and computational methods, the project investigates how these interacting forces shape the long-term dynamics of strategic competition.
